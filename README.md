# Inspect Node Data
SOP-level HDA for storing, retrieving, and inspecting parameters from nodes.

~~***Currently Python 3 though I might backport it to work with both (sorry but I love `f"` strings!)***~~

[Check out the demo video here](https://vimeo.com/591895400)

This node uses a Dictionary Attribute to store parameter data from the Attribute from Parameters SOP and retrieve it for inspection. This is useful for storing data about how a cache was generated when wedging values.

See help card and demo file for more info.
